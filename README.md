## Skills & Spells 🧙‍♂️

```typescript
const skills = [
  "TypeScript", "Node.js", "Next.js", "tRPC",
  "SQL & NoSQL Databases", "REST & GraphQL APIs",
  "Cloud (AWS, GCP)", "CI/CD Pipelines"
];
const spells = ["🔮 System Architecture", "💻 Code Quality",
                "🚀 Scalability & Performance", "🤝 Mentorship"];
```

## Achievements Unlocked 🏆

* ⚙️ Built and scaled backend systems into **core, business-critical platforms**.
